## DSSS Theory
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is a technique used in telecommunications where the data signal is spread over a wider bandwidth by multiplying it with a pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence, also known as a spreading code. This increases the signal's resistance to interference and eavesdropping.
