## DSSS Theory
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is a technique used in telecommunications where the data signal is spread over a wider bandwidth by multiplying it with a pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence, also known as a spreading code. This increases the signal's resistance to interference and eavesdropping.

Spread Spectrum Techniques:

Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS): Data is spread over a wide frequency band by multiplying the signal with a pseudo-random noise code.
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS): The carrier frequency hops among many frequencies according to a pseudo-random sequence.
Applications: Used in military communications, GPS, and some wireless LAN technologies (e.g., early versions of Wi-Fi).
