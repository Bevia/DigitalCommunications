Digital telecommunications modulation is a process used to encode digital information (such as data, voice, or video) onto a carrier signal for transmission over a communication channel. In digital modulation, the carrier signal—typically a high-frequency sine wave—is altered in a way that represents the digital data. The three primary aspects of the carrier that can be modified are:

1. **Amplitude** (Amplitude Shift Keying, ASK): The amplitude (strength) of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the digital data.
2. **Frequency** (Frequency Shift Keying, FSK): The frequency (rate of oscillation) of the carrier wave is altered based on the digital information.
3. **Phase** (Phase Shift Keying, PSK): The phase (position) of the carrier wave is shifted to represent the digital data.

More advanced forms of digital modulation combine these basic techniques. For example, Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) combines amplitude and phase modulation to increase the data rate.

Digital modulation is essential in modern communication systems, enabling efficient and reliable transmission of information over various media, including radio, fiber optics, and wireless networks.

1. **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**:
   - **Description**: FSK modulates the frequency of the carrier signal to represent data. The simplest form, Binary FSK (BFSK), uses two frequencies to represent binary 0 and 1.
   - **Applications**: Used in radio transmissions, RFID systems, and early modems.

2. **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**:
   - **Description**: ASK modulates the amplitude of the carrier signal to represent data. Binary ASK (BASK) uses two different amplitudes to represent binary 0 and 1.
   - **Applications**: Used in optical fiber communications and RFID systems.

3. **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**:
   - **Beyond BPSK and QPSK**:
     - **8-PSK (8-Phase Shift Keying)**: Uses eight different phase shifts to encode three bits per symbol.
     - **16-PSK**: Uses sixteen phase shifts to encode four bits per symbol.

4. **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**:
   - **Description**: OFDM divides the data stream into several parallel sub-streams, each modulated by a different carrier frequency. These sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, minimizing interference.
   - **Applications**: Widely used in modern broadband communications, including Wi-Fi, LTE, and digital television.

5. **Spread Spectrum Techniques**:
   - **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)**: Data is spread over a wide frequency band by multiplying the signal with a pseudo-random noise code.
   - **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**: The carrier frequency hops among many frequencies according to a pseudo-random sequence.
   - **Applications**: Used in military communications, GPS, and some wireless LAN technologies (e.g., early versions of Wi-Fi).

6. **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)**:
   - **Description**: PAM modulates the amplitude of pulses in a signal. Each pulse can have multiple amplitude levels to encode more than one bit per pulse.
   - **Applications**: Used in Ethernet and some optical fiber communication systems.

7. **Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM)**:
   - **Description**: TCM combines modulation and error correction coding in one process, using a trellis diagram to improve data reliability without increasing bandwidth.
   - **Applications**: Used in high-speed modem standards, such as V.32 and V.34.

8. **Carrierless Amplitude Phase (CAP)**:
   - **Description**: CAP modulation is similar to QAM but does not require a carrier signal, making it more efficient for certain applications.
   - **Applications**: Used in some DSL technologies.

These modulation schemes are chosen based on various factors like bandwidth efficiency, power efficiency, noise immunity, and implementation complexity. They play a crucial role in determining the performance and reliability of telecommunications systems.
