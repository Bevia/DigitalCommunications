## How to run:
    g++ ./OFDM/ofdm_.cpp ./OFDM/ofdm_.cpp -o ofdm 
### To enable C++11, use the following command:
    g++ -std=c++11 ./OFDM/ofdm_.cpp -o ./OFDM/ofdm_.cpp -o ofdm 
#### To run the program, use this command:
    ./ofdm

### compile the FTTW3 library...find the route of the lib and do the following:
g++ -std=c++11 -o ofdm_ ./OFDM/ofdm_.cpp -lfftw3 -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/fftw/3.3.10_1/lib/ -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/fftw/3.3.10_1/include

## OFDM Theory
This example focuses on the basic steps of OFDM: generating random data, performing the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to create OFDM symbols, and adding a cyclic prefix for transmission. This example uses the FFTW library for performing the IFFT.

###Â Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM):

Description: OFDM divides the data stream into several parallel sub-streams, each modulated by a different carrier frequency. 
These sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, minimizing interference.
Applications: Widely used in modern broadband communications, including Wi-Fi, LTE, and digital television.

### python plot ofdm constellation
python3 ./OFDM/ofdm_constellation.py

Generate Random Data: generate_random_data generates a list of random bits.
QPSK Modulation: qpsk_modulation maps pairs of bits to QPSK symbols. In QPSK, each pair of bits is mapped to a complex symbol with specific in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components.
Plot Constellation: plot_constellation plots the complex symbols on a 2D plane to visualize the constellation diagram.

### python modulate ofdm
python3 ./OFDM/modulate_ofdm.py

make sure you install: pip install scipy

you can modulate data to see the effects of OFDM. We'll expand the previous example by including the steps for OFDM modulation. Specifically, we'll perform the following steps:

    Generate random data bits.
    Perform QPSK modulation on the data bits.
    Map the QPSK symbols to OFDM subcarriers.
    Perform IFFT to convert the frequency domain symbols to time domain.
    Add a cyclic prefix.
    Plot the time domain signal and the constellation diagram.

    This code demonstrates the basic process of creating an OFDM signal. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

    Generate Random Data: A function generates random bits.
    QPSK Modulation: The random bits are modulated using QPSK, converting bits into complex symbols.
    Perform IFFT: The IFFT is applied to the QPSK symbols to create the OFDM time-domain signal.
    Add Cyclic Prefix: A cyclic prefix is added to the beginning of each OFDM symbol to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI).
